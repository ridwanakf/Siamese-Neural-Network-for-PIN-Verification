# Siamese-Neural-Network-for-PIN-Verification
I create a Neural Network model using Siamese architecture to distinguish between real user and impostor when inputting pin number on various mobile app payment method. It takes multiple sensor data as input, and the model will evaluate whether the newly input pin is the real user or not by learning his/her tapping behaviour
